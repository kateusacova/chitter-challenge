# Modelling and Planning a Web application

## Step 0: User stories or specification

```
STRAIGHT UP

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can better appreciate the context of a peep
I want to see the time at which it was made

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

HARDER

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter

ADVANCED

As a Maker
So that I can stay constantly tapped in to the shouty box of Chitter
I want to receive an email if I am tagged in a Peep
```

## Step 0.2: Planning tables

Table: users
- login
- password
- email

Table: peeps
- content
- tagged_users
- date
- time
- user_id

## Step 0.3: Planning Model & Repo Classes

### User

```ruby

```

### Peep


## Step 1: Planning pages

## Step 2: Planning routes

Remember that a web application flow is all based on the HTTP request-response cycle, from
the web browser to the server application. You'll now need to draw your routes from the
pages you planned at the previous step.

This time, we're switching from the user perspective to the HTTP application engineer's
perspective - thinking of the application's behaviour in requests and responses, rather
than pages.

For example:

 * A page (such as the home page) is usually returned by a `GET` route. For example, the
   home page (which is almost always the first route you'll start with), is usually `GET
   /`.
 * If the user navigates to a different page using a link, you will need a `GET` route for
   this other page.
 * If the user submits a form that leads to a different page, you will need a `POST` route
   to submit this form to.

From the pages planned above, here are the routes we could plan. Once again, this is only
a possible list of routes for this case â€” you could come up with slightly different ones,
which would still satisfy the initial user stories.

# Page: Homepage

## Request:
GET /
No parameters

## Response (200 OK)
- Welcome message
- Sign up link
- Log in link
- Peeps feed (chronological order)

# Page: Sign up page

## Request:
GET /
No parameters

## Response (200 OK)
- Returns sign up form to put: username, password,
